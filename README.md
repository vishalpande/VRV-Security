Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI Assignment 🚀
Objective 🎯
The goal of this project is to design and implement a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI for an admin dashboard. This interface will allow administrators to manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently and securely.

You have the flexibility to design the UI, define the features, and implement workflows that best suit an ideal RBAC system. Creativity is highly encouraged to enhance functionality and user experience.

Key Features & Requirements ⚙️
1. User Management 🧑‍💻
View and Manage Users: Display a list of users with the ability to add, edit, or delete them.
Assign Roles: Allow admins to assign roles to users (e.g., Admin, User, etc.).
User Status: Manage user status (e.g., Active/Inactive) for each user.
2. Role Management 🔑
Define and Edit Roles: Create a way to define roles and edit them (e.g., Admin, Manager, Viewer).
Permissions for Roles: Allow each role to include various permissions such as Read, Write, and Delete or custom attributes like specific module access.
3. Dynamic Permissions 🔐
Assign/Modify Permissions: Provide a simple interface for assigning or modifying permissions for roles.
Clear Display of Permissions: Display assigned permissions in a clear and user-friendly way.
4. Custom API Simulation (Optional) 💻
Mock CRUD Operations: Simulate API calls to perform CRUD operations for users and roles.
Server Response Simulation: Show simulated responses from the server (success, error, etc.) to validate functionality.
UI Design 💡
Flexibility in Design: Choose your preferred UI design (table views, modals, inline editing, etc.) to display and manage users and roles.
Creative Approach: Feel free to innovate and add additional features or designs to improve the UI and UX (user experience).
Framework: The UI can be built using any frontend framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) that you prefer.
